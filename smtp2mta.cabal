description:
        This is a simple SMTP server that forwards all mail to a
        sendmail-compatible script.
        .
        The primary intended use is to allow broken MUAs that expect to always
        send over SMTP to send with a standard MTA script.  (This allows one
        to authenticate with a mailserver using SSH keys, for example.)
        .
        The argument is the path to a script, not a shell command.  If you
        need special handling (such as parameters to SSH), it is intended that
        you create a simple shell script to handle this.  An example.sh is
        provided.
