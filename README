This is a simple SMTP server that forwards all mail to a
sendmail-compatible script.

The primary intended use is to allow broken MUAs that expect to always
send over SMTP to send with a standard MTA script.  (This allows one
to authenticate with a mailserver using SSH keys, for example.)

The argument is the path to a script, not a shell command.  If you
need special handling (such as parameters to SSH), it is intended that
you create a simple shell script to handle this.  An example.sh is
provided.
