This is a simple SMTP server that forwards all mail to a
sendmail-compatible script.

The primary intended use is to allow broken MUAs that expect to always
send over SMTP to send with a standard MTA script.  (This allows one
to authenticate with a mailserver using SSH keys, for example.)

smtp2mta can be run as a standalone server, or can serve connections
from behind inetd.
