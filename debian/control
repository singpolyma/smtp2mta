Description: Listen for SMTP traffic and send it to an MTA script
 This is a simple SMTP server that forwards all mail to a
 sendmail-compatible script.
 .
 The primary intended use is to allow broken MUAs that expect to always
 send over SMTP to send with a standard MTA script.  (This allows one
 to authenticate with a mailserver using SSH keys, for example.)
 .
 smtp2mta can be run as a standalone server, or can serve connections
 from behind inetd.
 .
